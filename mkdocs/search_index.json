If this configuration value is changed and no port is specified, the default of \"8946\" will be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-join\n - Address of another agent to join upon starting up. This can be specified multiple times to specify multiple agents to join. If Dkron is unable to join with any of the specified addresses, agent startup will fail. By default, the agent won't join any nodes when it starts up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-advertise\n - The advertise flag is used to change the address that we advertise to other nodes in the cluster. By default, the bind address is advertised. However, in some cases (specifically NAT traversal), there may be a routable address that cannot be bound to. This flag enables gossiping a different address to support this. If this address is not routable, the node will be in a constant flapping state, as other nodes will treat the non-routability as a failure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-http-addr\n - The address where the web UI will be binded. By default \n:8080\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-backend\n - Backend storage to use, etcd, consul or zk (zookeeper). The default is etcd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-backend-machine\n - Backend storage servers addresses to connect to. This flag can be specified multiple times. By default \n127.0.0.1:2379\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-tag\n - The tag flag is used to associate a new key/value pair with the agent. The tags are gossiped and can be used to provide additional information such as roles, ports, and configuration values to other nodes. Multiple tags can be specified per agent. There is a byte size limit for the maximum number of tags, but in practice dozens of tags may be used. Tags can be changed during a config reload.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-server\n - If this agent is a dkron server, just need to be present. Absent by default.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-keyspace\n - Keyspace to use for the store. Allows to run different instances using the same storage cluster. \ndkron\n by default.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-encrypt\n - Key for encrypting network traffic. Must be a base64-encoded 16-byte key.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-mail-host\n - Mail server host address to use for notifications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-mail-port\n - Mail server port.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-mail-username\n - Mail server username used for authentication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-mail-password\n - Mail server password to use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-mail-from\n - From email address to use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-webhook-url\n - Webhook url to call for notifications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-webhook-payload\n - Body of the POST request to send on webhook call.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-webhook-header\n - Headers to use when calling the webhook URL. Can be specified multiple times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-log-level\n - Set the log level (debug, info, warn, error, fatal, panic). Defaults to \"info\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-ui-dir\n - Directory from where to serve web UI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-rpc-port\n - The port that Dkron will use to bind for the agent's RPC server, defaults to \n6868\n.

It's a powerful system that allows you to extend and adapt Dkron to your special needs.\n\n\nThis page documents the basics of how the plugin system in Dkron works, and how to setup a basic development environment for plugin development if you're writing a Dkron plugin.\n\n\nHow it Works\n\n\nDkron execution execution processors are provided via plugins. Each plugin exposes functionality for modifying the execution. Plugins are executed as a separate process and communicate with the main Dkron binary over an RPC interface.\n\n\nThe code within the binaries must adhere to certain interfaces. The network communication and RPC is handled automatically by higher-level libraries. The exact interface to implement is documented in its respective documentation section.\n\n\nInstalling a Plugin\n\n\nDkron searches for plugins at startup, to install a plugin just drop the binary in one of the following locations:\n\n\n\n\n/etc/dkron/plugins\n\n\nDkron executable directory\n\n\n\n\nExecution Processors\n\n\nProcessor plugins are called when an execution response has been received. They are passed the resulting execution data and configuration parameters, this plugins can perform a variety of operations with the execution and it's very flexible and per Job, examples of operations this plugins can do:\n\n\n\n\nExecution output storage, forwarding or redirection.\n\n\nNotification\n\n\nMonitoring\n\n\n\n\nCurrently Dkron provides you with some stock plugins but the list keeps growing. Some of the features previously implemented in the application will be progessively moved to plugins.\n\n\nLogging processors\n\n\nLogging output of each job execution can be modified by using processor plugins.\n\n\nProcessor plugins can be used to redirect the output of a job execution to different targets.\n\n\nProcessors are set per job using the \nprocessors\n property. \nprocessors\n is an object of processor plugins to use and it's corresponding configuration. To know what parameters each plugin accepts refer to the plugin documentation.\n\n\nBuilt-in logging processors\n\n\nDepending on your needs the execution log can be redirected using the following plugins:\n\n\n\n\nnot specified - Store the output in the key value store (Slow performance, good for testing, default method)\n\n\nlog - Output the execution log to Dkron stdout (Good performance, needs parsing)\n\n\nsyslog - Output to the syslog (Good performance, needs parsing)\n\n\nfiles - Output to multiple files (Good performance, needs parsing)\n\n\n\n\nAll plugins accepts one configuration option: \nforward\n Indicated if the plugin must forward the original execution output. This allows for chaining plugins and sending output to different targets at the same time.\n\n\nUsing plugins\n\n\nFor each job you can configure an arbitrary number of plugins.\n\n\n{\n    \nname\n: \njob_name\n,\n    \ncommand\n: \n/bin/true\n,\n    \nschedule\n: \n@every 2m\n,\n    \ntags\n: {\n        \nrole\n: \nweb\n\n    },\n    \nprocessors\n: {\n        \nfiles\n: {\n            \nforward\n: true\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nDeveloping a Plugin\n\n\nAdvanced topic! Plugin development is a highly advanced topic, and is not required knowledge for day-to-day usage. If you don't plan on writing any plugins, we recommend not reading the following section of the documentation.\n\n\n\nDeveloping a plugin is simple. The only knowledge necessary to write a plugin is basic command-line skills and basic knowledge of the Go programming language.\n\n\nNote: A common pitfall is not properly setting up a \n$GOPATH\n. This can lead to strange errors. You can read more about this here to familiarize yourself.\n\n\nCreate a new Go project somewhere in your \n$GOPATH\n. If you're a GitHub user, we recommend creating the project in the directory \n$GOPATH/src/github.com/USERNAME/dkron-NAME-TYPE\n, where \nUSERNAME\n is your GitHub username and \nNAME\n is the name of the plugin you're developing. This structure is what Go expects and simplifies things down the road.\n\n\nWith the directory made, create a main.go file. This project will be a binary so the package is \"main\":\n\n\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \ngithub.com/victorcoder/dkron/plugin\n\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    plugin.Serve(\nplugin.ServeOpts{\n        Processor: new(MyPlugin),\n    })\n}\n\n\n\n\nAnd that's basically it! You'll have to change the argument given to plugin.Serve to be your actual plugin, but that is the only change you'll have to make. The argument should be a structure implementing one of the plugin interfaces (depending on what sort of plugin you're creating).\n\n\nDkron plugins must follow a very specific naming convention of \ndkron-TYPE-NAME\n. For example, \ndkron-processor-files\n, which tells Dkron that the plugin is a processor that can be referenced as \"files\".",

Built-in logging processors  Depending on your needs the execution log can be redirected using the following plugins:   not specified - Store the output in the key value store (Slow performance, good for testing, default method)  log - Output the execution log to Dkron stdout (Good performance, needs parsing)  syslog - Output to the syslog (Good performance, needs parsing)  files - Output to multiple files (Good performance, needs parsing)   All plugins accepts one configuration option:  forward  Indicated if the plugin must forward the original execution output. This allows for chaining plugins and sending output to different targets at the same time.",

If you don't plan on writing any plugins, we recommend not reading the following section of the documentation.  Developing a plugin is simple. The only knowledge necessary to write a plugin is basic command-line skills and basic knowledge of the Go programming language.  Note: A common pitfall is not properly setting up a  $GOPATH . This can lead to strange errors. You can read more about this here to familiarize yourself.  Create a new Go project somewhere in your  $GOPATH . If you're a GitHub user, we recommend creating the project in the directory  $GOPATH/src/github.com/USERNAME/dkron-NAME-TYPE , where  USERNAME  is your GitHub username and  NAME  is the name of the plugin you're developing. This structure is what Go expects and simplifies things down the road.  With the directory made, create a main.go file. This project will be a binary so the package is \"main\":  package main\n\nimport (\n     github.com/victorcoder/dkron/plugin \n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    plugin.Serve( plugin.ServeOpts{\n        Processor: new(MyPlugin),\n    })\n}  And that's basically it! You'll have to change the argument given to plugin.Serve to be your actual plugin, but that is the only change you'll have to make. The argument should be a structure implementing one of the plugin interfaces (depending on what sort of plugin you're creating).  Dkron plugins must follow a very specific naming convention of  dkron-TYPE-NAME . For example,  dkron-processor-files , which tells Dkron that the plugin is a processor that can be referenced as \"files\".",
