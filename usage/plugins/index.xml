      <description>Executors Executors plugins are the main mechanism of execution in Dkron. They implement different &amp;ldquo;types&amp;rdquo; of jobs in the sense that they can perform the most diverse actions on the target nodes.
For example, the built-in shell executor, will run the indicated command in the target node.
New plugins will be added, or you can create new ones, to perform different tasks, as HTTP requests, Docker runs, anything that you can imagine.</description>

      <description>Developing a Plugin Advanced topic! Plugin development is a highly advanced topic, and is not required knowledge for day-to-day usage. If you don&amp;rsquo;t plan on writing any plugins, we recommend not reading the following section of the documentation. Developing a plugin is simple. The only knowledge necessary to write a plugin is basic command-line skills and basic knowledge of the Go programming language.
Note: A common pitfall is not properly setting up a $GOPATH.</description>
